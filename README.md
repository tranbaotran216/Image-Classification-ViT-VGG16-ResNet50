# Image-Classification-ViT-VGG16-ResNet50
Lab4 - CS406 UIT

This project trains and compares three image classification models:

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
- **VGG16**
- **ResNet50**

After training, a **Streamlit** app is provided to:

- Upload an image
- Run inference on all three models
- Compare **predicted class, confidence, and inference time**
- Visualize **confidence** and **inference time** with bar charts

---

## Environment Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt

- **Training dependencies** – để train ViT/VGG16/ResNet50 (run on Kaggle).
- **App dependencies** –  Streamlit UI for inference.
